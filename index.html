  <p>Hi! My name is Michalina. I am 13 years old and go to grade 9. In my short life, I have already accomplished quite a sum of things. </p>
  
	<button class="collapsible"><i>click here to find out more about my breath-taking journey ...</i></button>

<div class= "content">
	<p>
		My father is a computational engineer, so I was exposed to computers at a  <a target = "_blank" href= "/Content/2019-11-17_FirstComputer.png"><font color = "#FF7F50">very young age</font></a>.
		It all started out when I was 4 years old. 
		My father was on the Grasshopper Forum searching for new updates, whilst I was sitting next to him; watching his screen intently.
		Then, I saw the <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.grasshopper3d.com/group/ladybug/forum/topics/update-happy-yalda?commentId=2985220%3AComment%3A1341141&groupId=2985220%3AGroup%3A658987"><font color = "#FF7F50">Honeybee icon </font></a> and I asked, “What is that?”
	  My father answered me, explaining to me what it was.
    I looked at him and exclaimed, “Bees aren’t yellow!”
		This made an idea sprout in my father’s mind and he wrote to <a target = "_blank" href="https://github.com/mostaphaRoudsari"><font color = "#FF7F50">Mostapha</font></a>; together we created a fitting color scheme and the Honeybee icon was adjusted. 
    From that day onwards, not only was I pleased, but I also had new stickers on my computer to celebrate the success.
		</br>
		</br>
  You might be wondering why I was so shocked with the colour of the honeybee. The reason was that, before that time, I had already spent <a target = "_blank" href= "/Content/GraftingEggsQueenBee.JPG"><font color = "#FF7F50">a lot of time  with bees</font></a>; since my father was a beekeeper before he became an engineer. 
  We would always go to an apiary for the holidays, where I learnt quite a lot about these amazing creatures. 
  I marked queen bees, "rescued" them from the lake, ate a lot of honey and made waxed candles. I really enjoyed melting the wax, and waited in anticipation to see how the candles would turn out.
		</br>
		</br>
	Roughly, at that time in my father’s office, located in Berlin, there was a commotion going on, about how <a target = "_blank" href= "/Content/2019-11-17_Revit.png"><font color = "#FF7F50">Revit</font> </a>and BIM are not suited for Germany and, that, you should use AutoCAD instead. People said that Revit is too hard, and that AutoCAD is just generally better. 
	He wanted to convince his coworkers, that this wasn't the case, so,	 he asked me if I wanted to build the house of my dreams, and also furnish it. 
		I was dumbstruck, as any child would be in my age, and agreed at once. 
		Over the weekend, I built and furnished my dream house with a little help from my father. 
		When my father came back to the office on Monday, he had a presentation on Revit. 
  At the end of it he said, “You can do it, if my 4-year-old daughter can”. 
  From that moment onwards, Revit started being used.
		</br>
		</br>
		When I was 5 years old, an architect made a workshop in our Kindergarten and we made our own <a target = "_blank" href= "/Content/PrototypeFirstModel.JPG"><font color = "#FF7F50">cardboard houses </font></a>. 
  When I got home, my father saw my work and asked me if I wanted to see how different animals around the world would feel in my house. 
		
		I did not fully understand what he meant, but agreed anyways. 
		He used Ladybug Tools in <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.grasshopper3d.com/profile/MichalinaDengusiak"><font color = "#FF7F50">Grasshopper</font> </a> to explain to me the different positions of the sun. Together we did a sun path analysis on my prototype.
  Then, at the end, we created a new model in Rhino, and change its location to different climate regions, just to see how it differed.  
		</br>
		</br>
		I found this very interesting and had a lot of fun doing this.
    Therefore, my father thought that maybe programming would engulf me as well.
		That's how I started out with <a target = "_blank" href = "https://scratch.mit.edu/"><font color = "#FF7F50">Scratch</font></a>, a program that seemed like a game to me. 
		I would spend a lot of time working on new games, and, without my knowledge getting a head start into the computational world. 
		Soon, I found out about <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.python.org/"><font color = "#FF7F50">Python</a></font>, a basic yet fun program. 
		It grabbed my attention immediately since it was easy, yet it gave you lots of possibilities.
		So, I completed a course on <a target = "_blank" href= "/Content/cert-1073-10595912.jpg"><font color = "#FF7F50">Sololearn</font></a> to deepen my knowledge about it.
		This was a huge accomplishment, and thanks to this course I can now program some things in Python. 
		</br>
		</br>
		Afterwards, my father and <a target = "_blank" href="https://github.com/theo-armour"><font color = "#FF7F50">Theo</font></a> were working on Ladybug Tools Spider gbXML Viewer, and I helped them. I recorded the user guide videos for them!
    It was a very fun process even though it was difficult at times, now when I look at it I am always impressed and proud with what I created.
		</br>
		</br>
		My father showed me the GitHub desktop app and Git Bash- since,at that time, he was doing a tutorial about them.
		To his surprise, I found Git Bash way easier than the desktop app, and to this day I primarily use Git Bash. 
		He said that a lot of people in his work complained about Git Bash being too hard.
		So, he thought that he will show it to me and I would decide whether it was too hard or just right.
		I don’t understand why he would be surprised it’s just easier since you only need to write about two or four words whereas in the desktop app you have to search for functions for like 20 minutes...
		</br>
		</br>
		At the beginning of 7th grade, I was surprised and very pleased to be invited to <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.paramateria.com/" ><font color = "#FF7F50">PARAMETRIA</font></a>. This was a course where instructors focused on teaching about parametric design, digital manufacturing and product develeopment. Each week, you would focus on a new project with an instructor, design your product in Grasshopper and manufacture it at the end. 
		It was an amazing experience which gave me the opportunity to witness the process of how an idea of a product ends up in a shop being sold. 
    I was at the part of the course which focused on parametric façades and was led by <a target = "_blank" href = "https://github.com/mateuszzwierzycki"><font color = "#FF7F50">Mateusz Zwierzycki</font></a>. We were creating a Parametric Responsive Facade that would, in summer block the sunlight to protect from overheating, whilst in winter allow the sunlight to enter the room in order heat it.
    We started the course with brainstorming and <a  target = "_blank" href= "/Content/Parametria_PrototypingPaperModel.JPG"><font color = "#FF7F50">prototyping</font></a> ideas on paper in order to think of a design which would allow the sunlight to comke in or block it depending on the weather. The next step was to program this in Rhino with Grasshopper components. Then, in order to decrease the time of the code, as well as to improve it, we translated these components to C# code. At the end we manufactured the façade by laser cutting the cardboard and making the frame out of wood. 
		</br>
		</br>
    This was a totally new experience for me and I was surprised that you could program all of this in Rhino!
    Before, I never thought it was possible to use a program, I knew, to design and fabricate an actual object/product... 
		This really revolutionised the way I thought of programs and computer programming languages.
    I was also very determined to learn more about Rhino and Grasshopper, and even C#, in order to be able to do this one day all by myself.
		</br>
		</br>
		As I was learning more about Grasshopper, I found out about <a target = "_blank" href = "https://topologic.app/"><font color = "#FF7F50">Topologic</font></a>. 
    I started learning more aboiut it as I wanted to incorporate it into a further project involving building the Chernobyl factory later on.
    As I first started with Topologic the names of the geometry (e.g. shell, cluster, cellcomplex) confused me, yet then I looked through the class hierarchy and the structure of the topologic idea and it seemed a bit easier. 
    However, through practice of using the components I gained more knowledge and now I am used to it. 
    But, I really like the concept of Topologic as it tells you if your model could actually be built.  
		</br>
		</br>
    In 7th grade from the 27th until the 31st of January 2020, I had an internship at <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.mcneel.com/eu/contact"><font color = "#FF7F50"> McNeel Europe S.L.</font></a> in Barcelona.
		This was the <a target = "_blank" href = "\Content\Michalin_Before_McNeel_Compound.jpeg"><font color = "#FF7F50">best internship</font></a> I ever had ![Eventhough, I must admit that it was my first one :)]
		The people in the office were very open and very welcoming, and I was surprised that they were so <a target = "_blank" href = "\Content\Michalina_Programming_Python.jpeg"><font color = "#FF7F50">nice to me.</a></font>
    Also, the office had a strong community, as everybody knew each other and always helped one another.
    Before this, I thought that maybe in the internship I would have half an hour of programming and the rest of the time I would be bringing them coffee, cleaning, etc. That's at least what my teacher told me I would be doing.
    Yet, when I got there, I was always programming, <a target = "_blank" href= "\Content\Xavi_showing_Michalina_3dprinted_model.jpeg"><font color = "#FF7F50">3D printing</a></font> or learning something new! 
    I was overjoyed, and it was amazing ;)
    </br> I had 2 projects that I worked on during the internship,the first one was to 3D print a Chernobyl powerplant model, and the second was to start working on a snapping to grid program. In order to print the Chernobyl model, first I had to find an original blueprint with measurements of the powerplant, second I built it in Grasshopper, and at the end I used Topologic in order to generate it as a water-tight model. Then, what remained was to export it to the format of the 3D printer. The rest of the internship I was trying to develop a program that would accept any 2D geometry and snap it to a grid.
    </br>
    This experience has also showed me what it would look like to work as programmer in a software development company and the only thing I can say is, "I want to work like that as well!"
    </br>
    </br>
		During the beginning of Corona (in March 2021), I was doing online schooling like the rest of the schools in Germany.
    The reason behind this is because the government wanted to take safety precautions against the Coronavirus, so schools were closed for 3 weeks.
    This was very exciting for me since I could spend more time programming and try out the concept of homeschooling, which I always wanted to do! :)
		</br>
		</br>
		Also, during COVID the amazing Rhino Barcelona Team provided me with a C# course, "Essential Guide to C# Scripting for Grasshopper" by Rajaa Issa.
    This course was incredible and really helped me to understand what a beautiful language C# really is.
    Before this course, I understood that it was a powerful language though I deemed it unnecessairly long and complicated... However, now Ms.Issa opened my eyes to what this language actually is and I strongly beleive that she can also convince many other poeple to use this language and to make them finally understand how this language functions and how to use it!
    </br>
    </br>
    I uploaded a new video about how to create a model based on 2D geometry that you can also push to Revit, TAS and Honeybee. This is based on a problem that I found on <a target = "_blank" href= "https://discourse.mcneel.com/t/is-there-a-way-to-create-a-room-automatically-using-room-separator-using-c-or-python/117550"><font color = "#FF7F50">Rhino Discourse</a></font>. I hope you enjoy it! Please share your opinions and feedback!
		</br>
		</br>
    During the Easter Break of 2021, I was really bored and wanted to do something different and therefore I am doing an internship at my fathers company, Hoare Lea. I was editing the SAM Github repos as well as editing the names of the SAM components (which are found in Grasshopper).

		</br>
		This is another of my favorite books. 
		It is about a society where the rich and poor are divided by a wall, the poor starving and the rich enjoying their lives.
		Also, they believe in a myth which results in the male marrying two wives: a Primera and a Segunda.
		The Primera is the wise female who isn't allowed to express emotions, she is supposed to help her husband make decisions.
		Furthermore, she has to dress plain.
		The Segunda is the opposite of the Primera, she is the one who brings the happiness into the house.
		She will be the mother and also dresses with rich colours to express her job at the house.
		It is about a girl called Dani,who goes to the Medio Shool for Girls which trains these "perfect" wives.
		She trains to become a Primera, but she needs to act as if she is from the big city since her parents secretely took her over the wall with fake papers.
		The school teaches her how to switch through different personalities, thus becoming a great actor, and great at decieving people.
		Before the ceremony, the government needs to check their papers with a new method which checks fake papers.
		Dani's only chance of survival is joining forces with La Voz, as in exchange for her part-taking for real ID papers.
		As in the Ceremony is paired with her husband, the most influential male in the World and her arch-nemesis, she joins a secret organization calles La Voz.
		La Voz wants equality so that rich or poor alike have the same possibilities and homes.
		Will she be able to survive? Will she cope with her enemy? Will she decieve everybody around her?...

		</br>
		This is a book about weird things happening in Russia, because of the Devil who came with his gang.
		They are quite unique, however personally I love their jokes and personality.
		They make a lot of misshappens in the town, however providing happiness to one couple.
		The master, who writes a novel about Pontius Pilate; and his lover Margarita who loves the Master very much.
		Now, I can't tell you anymore to not spoil the book.
		However, I recommend reading this book since you will understand literature and the way he writes is extraordinary!
		It is amazing, also the jokes he puts in, if you need something to challenge you this is perfect.
		In order to read this book you need to pay attention to everything and also the vocabulary is quite advance.

	<font size="20"> Dog News:</font></p>
	It all started with me working at an animal shelter... 
	In the summer vacation I decided to do something, as I was bored, so the first thing that came to my mind was the animal shelter. 
	It was really disgusting, filthy and it stunk there, so I knew that I had to clean there. 
	The next day I went there and cleaned everything that I could put my hands on.
	Over the next few days the workers there allowed me to take on harder jobs. 
	One of those was to clean a dog's cage. 
	There was my soon-to-be puppy. 
	She was jumping around the whole cage trying to get our (my and my cousin's) attention, she was so excited and happy. 
	At one point, I needed to sing to her for her to calm down, whilst rocking her gently like a small child.
	I started to think of her more often then...
	</br>
  </br>
	But I wasn't in love with her, not yet. 
	That happened when I took her out on her first walk outside of the shelter.
	She was so curious and energetic, that I needed to take her home.
	</br>
  </br>
	Well, at the beginning, I had to convince my parents. 
  </br>
  </br>
  We, me and my cousin, went to the animal shelter. 
  There the workers were already waiting for us and told us what we could do today. One of those being taking pictures of the dogs, in order to put them on the Facebook page so that they had a bigger chance of getting adopted. So, we were supposed to surprisingly take photos of that puppy!
  </br>
  </br>
  When I came home the next day, I innocently remarked about a puppy. I ran with her the whole time, she was so cute, I said. We even took so the photos we ended up reading and watching videos about her breed (what we thought was her breed). 
  </br>
  <br>
  The next day, my father came with me to look at her and he immediately fell in love with her... Not that he will admit it. We walked and spent time with her for about 2-3 hours. My father said it would be a great responsibility to take care of her. But I said I would cancel my bootcamps in order to get to know her. This was the bomb sentence, and they were so impressed with my commitment they said they would think about it. After 10 more minutes, my dad decided that we were ready for this, and he called my mom to seal the deal. Afterwards,when we came back to the shelter, it turned out that already 5 people called about adopting her!
